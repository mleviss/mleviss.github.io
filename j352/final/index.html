        <h1>Formula 1 Has Been Racing Since 1950, Why are we Just Learning About It? </h1>

        <p>Formula One, the pinnacle of motor racing across the globe, is set to have three Grand Prix in the United
            States next season. However, for most of its history, the sport has been overshadowed by NASCAR and
            American IndyCar. Where has this surge in popularity come from, and what has finally brought F1 to the
            United States? </p>

        <p>Formula One has competed in the US for decades across several circuits. Unfortunately, a lack of revenue
            and interest in the races led to the series abandoning several events and attempts.</p>

        <p>2017, Liberty Media bought the Formula One racing series and its televisiom.

            The American-based media conglomerate is also in the ownership group of the Atlanta Braves baseball
            team.
        </p>

        <p>Liberty Media had a main mission in mind, capture the American audience. According to the New York Times,
            “Carey [Exective Chairman of Formula One] told investors… that he planned to build the sport’s fan base
            by ‘telling the Formula One story’ and expanding its digital presence, something the series has
            struggled with as it seeks a younger audience.” </p>

        <p>One year after, Formula One signed an agreement with the major American sports network ESPN, to broadcast
            races, qualifying and even practices across the country. This made the series more accessible as well as
            viewable with other sports. </p>

        <p>The most powerful move Liberty Media made came the following year when they partnered with Netflix.
            Together, they produced Formula 1: Drive to Survive, a reality docu-series following along with the
            drivers and teams, behind the scenes, through the season. The show was an immediate success in
            viewership, attendance, and fandom. </p>

        <p>According to Formula One, “...Season 4 of Drive to Survive became the most-watched Netflix series in 33
            countries, including the United States, and more than a
            <a id="link2" href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890">

            </a>
            third of the spectators in Austin [US Grand
            Prix] last year mentioned Drive to Survive in an on-site survey about why they decided to attend.”
        </p>

        <p>Race viewership has continued to rise since the creation of the show. ESPN reported that “Through [the
            first] five races, the 2022 F1 season is averaging 1.4 million viewers per race, up 49 percent over the
            2021 season average (949,000 viewers) and up 131 percent over the 2020 season average (609,000
            viewers).” </p>



        <p>In 2012, the United State Grand Prix had slightly over one million viewers. A decade later, the 2022
            Miami Grand Prix had 2.6 million American viewers. This chart from the Washingston Post shows the drastic
            spik in viewership following Liberty Media's purchase.</p>

            
        <p>The sport has come under its fair share of criticism for its US based focus. Some were impressed with the
            <img src="chart.webp">
            American pragentry that was brought to the 
            inaugural Miami Grand Prix. Others were somewhat put off.
        </p>

        <p>Bruce Schoenfeld of the New York Times wrote, “The inaugural Miami Grand Prix felt less like a sports
            event than a high-end theme park.
            There was a fake beach and sunbathing areas where spectators brandishing margaritas seemed only vaguely
            aware that cars were hurtling at insane speeds around them.”
        </p>

        <p>Criticism aside, the sport is in its most successful and stable period in history. New interest from the
            Volkwagon group come to show the professional development the sport has gone through.</p>

        <p>Liberty Media paid over $400 million for a car racing series on the decline with the intention of taking
            it to the one place it could never reach. In just the last 7 years, Formula One has exponentially grown
            in popularity and continues to gain a fanbase with every new season of Drive to Survive.</p>
