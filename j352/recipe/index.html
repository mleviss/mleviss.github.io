   <strong><h1>Bacon Chicken Thighs</h1>
 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul> 4 slices thick bacon<br> 
    4 large bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs <br>
    salt and pepper <br>
    1 small red onion, peeled and finely chopped <br>
    8 large white caps mushrooms, stem removed and sliced <br>
    2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced <br>
    ¾ cup sodium-free chicken stock <br>
    ¾ cup heavy cream <br>
    ⅓ cup of grated parmesan cheese <br>
    1 small bunch of fresh thyme <br>
    juice of ½ lemon <br> 
    fresh parsley for garnish (optional) </ul>

 <h2> Preparation </h2>
    <p>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until crispy, about 8 minutes. Drain the slices over a paper towel-lined plate and reserve about 2 tablespoons of the fat rendered in the skillet</p>

    <p>Season generously with salt and pepper the chicken. Increase the heat to medium-high, then add the chicken, skin-side down. Cook until golden, about 5 -7 minutes per side. Skin needs to be crispy golden. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <p> Add onions and cook until soft. Stir in the mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Cook until golden, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and then the chicken stock, cream, parmesan cheese, thyme and lemon juice. Bring mixture to a simmer and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>

    <p> Return the chicken to the skillet and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 10 more minutes more. Chop the bacon and add it to the sauce. </p>

    <p> Garnish with fresh thyme or chopped parsley.</p>
